###Unsure if intended?

Not sure if this solution is intended by the game or not, the mode is a lot more focused on versing other players so it has some good rules set up for that, but I feel my solution is a bit gimmicky/cheaty for an NPC fight.

Might come back to this later and fix it, seems like a good solution is using REPL and kill commands to ensure you don't run out of EXAs
